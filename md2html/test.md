Okay, here are the notes for model evaluation and interpretation:

## Model Evaluation and Interpretation

Beyond estimating coefficients and testing hypotheses, we need to interpret what the coefficients mean and evaluate how well the overall model fits the data.

### Interpretation of Coefficients

For a model \( Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \dots + \beta_j X_j + \dots + \beta_q X_q + \epsilon \):

*   The coefficient \(\hat{\beta}_j\) represents the estimated **expected change** in the response variable \(Y\) for a **one-unit increase** in the predictor \(X_j\), **holding all other predictors (\(X_k\) for \(k \neq j\)) constant**.
*   **Key Aspects:**
    *   **Expected Change:** It refers to the change in the *average* value of \(Y\), averaging over the randomness (\(\epsilon\)).
    *   **Holding Others Constant:** This interpretation is crucial but depends on the predictors not being perfectly correlated. It isolates the estimated effect of \(X_j\).

### Goodness of Fit (R-squared)

**Problem:** Raw measures like the Residual Sum of Squares (RSS = \(\sum (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2\)) or Mean Squared Error (MSE = RSS / (n-p)) depend on the scale of \(Y\). A value like RSS = 700 doesn't tell us if the fit is good or bad without context. We need a standardized, absolute measure.

**Variance Decomposition:** The total variability in the response variable \(Y\) can be decomposed:
*   **Total Sum of Squares (TSS):** Measures the total variance of \(Y\) around its mean \(\bar{y}\).
    $$ \text{TSS} = \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \bar{y})^2 $$
*   **Regression Sum of Squares (SSReg):** Measures the variability explained by the regression model.
    $$ \text{SSReg} = \sum_{i=1}^n (\hat{y}_i - \bar{y})^2 $$
    where \(\hat{y}_i\) are the fitted values from the model.
*   **Residual Sum of Squares (RSS):** Measures the unexplained variability (error).
    $$ \text{RSS} = \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 $$

**Pythagorean Theorem for Regression:** For OLS regression, these components relate as:
$$ \text{TSS} = \text{SSReg} + \text{RSS} $$
$$ \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \bar{y})^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n (\hat{y}_i - \bar{y})^2 + \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 $$

**R-squared (\(R^2\)):** The coefficient of determination, \(R^2\), is defined as the proportion of the total variance in \(Y\) that is explained by the regression model.
$$ R^2 = \frac{\text{SSReg}}{\text{TSS}} = 1 - \frac{\text{RSS}}{\text{TSS}} $$
*   **Range:** \(R^2\) always falls between 0 and 1 (i.e., \(R^2 \in [0, 1]\)).
*   **Interpretation:**
    *   \(R^2 \approx 1\): The model explains a large proportion of the variability in \(Y\). Good fit.
    *   \(R^2 \approx 0\): The model explains very little variability in \(Y\). Poor fit.
*   **Independence from Assumptions:** The calculation and interpretation of \(R^2\) as a descriptive measure of fit do *not* depend on the statistical assumptions (like normality or homoscedasticity) required for inference. It's based purely on the variance decomposition.
